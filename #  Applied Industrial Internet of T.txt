## üö¶ Smart City Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates a **Smart City IoT simulation** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It integrates **smart surveillance**, **intelligent street lighting**, and **fire monitoring** to create a safer and more efficient urban environment.

##  Aim
To design and simulate an intelligent urban environment that uses IoT devices for **surveillance, automated street lighting, and fire detection**, providing real-time monitoring and automated responses.

## Problem Statement
Modern cities face challenges like security threats, energy wastage, and slow response to fire incidents.  
Manual monitoring of these events is inefficient and error-prone.  
This project builds a **smart city simulation** that automates these processes to enhance safety, reduce energy consumption, and enable quick response during emergencies.

##  Scope of the Solution
- **Smart Surveillance:** Motion-based monitoring using IoT cameras to detect intrusions.
- **Intelligent Street Lighting:** Streetlights that automatically turn ON when it is dark or motion is detected, saving energy.
- **Fire Monitoring:** Fire sensor system that detects smoke/fire and triggers alarms + sends alerts.
- **Automation:** All systems are fully automated using IoT rules.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded to cover larger city infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Components

### Software
- Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.x or higher)

### Hardware (Virtual in Simulation)
- **IoT Devices:**  
  - CCTV Camera (for surveillance)  
  - Motion Detector (PIR)  
  - Smart Street Lights  
  - Fire Sensors (Smoke/Heat)  
  - Alarm/Buzzer (Fire Alert)

## üîó Simulated Circuit (Cisco Packet Tracer)
The simulation is modeled as:  

- **Motion Detector ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí CCTV Camera ON** (for surveillance)  
- **Light Sensor ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Street Lights ON/OFF** (for energy saving)  
- **Fire Sensor ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Alarm ON + Notification to User**

You can use **IoT Rules** in the Home/City Gateway to define conditions and actions.
